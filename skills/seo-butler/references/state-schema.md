# Persistent Memory — `.seo-butler/state.json`

Written to the **target project root**, not the plugin. This is the butler's memory across runs: it
makes the butler consistent (trusts `done`, acts only on real deltas) instead of re-auditing settled
work and re-asking what it already learned. Read it first; keep it current.

## Location
`./.seo-butler/state.json` (create the `.seo-butler/` folder if missing).

**Suggest adding `.seo-butler/` to `.gitignore`.** It holds a business profile and site facts that
many people would rather not commit. If the user prefers to track it (the history is genuinely useful
in a team repo), that's their call — ask once, record the answer, don't ask again.

**Everything the butler writes goes under `.seo-butler/`** — screenshots, exports, downloaded CSVs,
scratch files, reports. The user's project root is theirs; leaving files there is rude and they end
up in `git status` as noise the user has to triage. Use `.seo-butler/tmp/` for anything transient and
delete it when the run ends. If a bundled tool insists on writing to the working directory anyway,
**say so at the end of the run and offer to add it to `.gitignore`** rather than leaving the user to
discover it later in `git status`.

**Migration from v1.x:** if `./.growth-butler/state.json` exists (from the growth-butler era), read it
as the baseline and write forward to `.seo-butler/`, then tell the user the old folder can be deleted.
If **both** `.growth-butler/` and an older `.seo-butler/` exist, `.growth-butler/` is the newer one —
it wins. Never lose the user's history. Drop any `families`, `journey`, `launch`, `ads`, `email`,
`social` or `content` blocks found in a v1 file; they belong to families this plugin no longer has.

## The profile
`project` + `business` together are the site profile. Beyond contact facts, capture the value
proposition, the target audience, and the brand voice — discovered from the site's real content. These
drive GEO topic targeting, `Organization` schema, and the tone of any copy the butler proposes.

## Rules
- The `business` profile is discovered from the site's real content, never invented. Populate it fully
  (valueProp/audience/brandVoice included) so a later run doesn't re-ask — and so GEO topic targeting
  and `Organization` schema have something real to work from.
- The `items` keys are **fixed** and mirror `checklist.md` one-for-one. Never add ad-hoc keys: anything
  in `items` that `scripts/weights.json` doesn't know about scores nothing, and `score.mjs` reports it
  as a warning rather than silently swallowing it.
- **Never store secrets here.** No API keys, tokens, passwords, or payment details — not in any block,
  not "temporarily". Credentials belong in the environment or the relevant provider's own store.
- The `deploy` block tracks **applied vs live**. `items` being `done` only means the change is in the
  codebase; until `liveVerifiedAt` is set by `/seo-live`, nothing has been proven in production and search
  engines may still see none of it. Keep `openFindings` populated while live issues remain unresolved.
- The `groundTruth` block is written by **`/seo-verify`** (`ground-truth.md`) and is what makes the
  convergence loop cheap on the second run. Three parts earn their keep:
  **`sources`** records what is connected and, for anything that isn't, *why* — so the next run
  doesn't re-attempt an OAuth the user declined, and so a missing source is never mistaken for a
  clean one. **`dismissed`** is the important one: an external false positive that isn't recorded
  comes back and costs the same investigation on every future run, so each entry stores the finding,
  the source, and the **evidence** that settled it. **`open`** carries what the user alone can fix
  (dashboard/CDN work) with the owner named, so it stays visible without being re-litigated.
  Never mark a finding `closed` on the strength of having applied a fix — `reverifiedAt` means the
  source was re-run afterwards and no longer reports it. Applied is not verified.
- The `watch` block is written by `/seo-watch` (`monitoring.md`) and is the **only** thing that command
  writes — it never edits the user's code. Its `history` gives each check a baseline to diff against, and
  `skipped` records what couldn't be checked (e.g. Search Console with no logged-in browser) so a gap is
  never mistaken for a pass.
- The `measurements.searchConsole` block is written by **`/seo-report`** (`reporting.md`) and is what
  makes month-over-month analysis possible. Every snapshot **must** carry `periodStart`, `periodEnd`
  and `source`: comparing two snapshots taken over different window lengths, or from different
  sources, is invalid, and without those fields a later run has no way to know. Keep ~12 entries in
  `history` so a **year-over-year** comparison — the only one that controls for seasonality — stays
  available. `ctr` is a fraction (0.033), not a percentage.
- The `measurements` block holds **externally produced numbers only** (`measurement.md`) — never the
  butler's own estimates. Whatever couldn't be measured goes in `unavailable` **with its reason**, so a
  later run shows an honest gap rather than a silent one. The top-level fields are the **latest**
  snapshot; before overwriting them, **push the old snapshot onto `history`** (append-only, keep the
  most recent ~10 and prune older to avoid unbounded growth). This is what lets a run show *movement*
  (e.g. "LCP 2.8s → 2.1s since 2026-07-15") instead of re-measuring from zero. Only compare like with
  like — same page, same `source`/`strategy`; never diff a lab number against a field number.
- **`source` names the rung that produced the numbers, and it is not decoration.** One of
  `"local-lighthouse"` (rung 1, the chrome-devtools MCP), `"lighthouse-cli"` (rung 2,
  `scripts/lighthouse-local.mjs` — a local browser plus the Lighthouse CLI), or `"psi"` (rung 3, the
  PageSpeed Insights API). They are three different harnesses that disagree by a few points on the
  same unchanged site, so a delta across two different sources is a harness change, not progress, and
  `measurement.md`'s trend rules refuse to render it as one. `"local-lighthouse"` keeps its old
  meaning on purpose: renaming it would make every history entry a user already has incomparable to
  their next measurement, which is the one thing history is for.
- On each run: read → treat `done`/`n/a` as settled → only re-open items whose scope changed
  (e.g. `pageCount` grew, new routes) or that are `partial`/`todo`.
- After applying, update every touched item's `status`, `date`, `scope`, `notes`, and append to
  `scoreHistory`.
- If nothing changed, still bump `lastRun` and report "Everything is current ✅".
- Store discovered `business` facts here so you don't ask again next time.
